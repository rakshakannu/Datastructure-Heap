// Binary heap datastructure is used to implement heap sort which is a popular sorting technique.
// it is also used to implement PRIORITY QUEUE.

// TWO TYPES:

1. MIN HEAP
highest priority item is assigned lowest value.

2. MAX HEAP
highest priority item is assigned highest value.

// BINARY HEAP
BINARY HEAP IS A COMPLETE BINARY TREE. 
complete binary tree - all levels are completely filled except for the last level and the last level should have been filled from left to right.

ADVANATAGE: we can store the binary heap datastructure as an ARRAY.
when we represent complete binary tree in an array, we dont create any gaps in the array and hence we dont waste any space.
left(i) = 2i+1
right(i) = 21+2
parent(i) = floor((i-1)/2)

they are cache friendly
they can have random access
they save space

// MIN HEAP

1. its a complete binary tree
2. every node has value smaller than its descendants
3. heap is just visual representation, in actual its stored as an array in the memory
